Exercise: experiment callbacks, Promises and async/await patterns

## Description 
To be able to read complex JavaScript and write good chunks of code, being familiar with callbacks, Promises and async/await patterns is primordial.
Hereâ€™s an exercise to experiment these notations:
* The goal is to create 7 services (simple timeout functions)
* Some services have no dependency and can start running from the beginning (#1, #2, #3 and #4)
* Some services have one level of dependencies:
    * Service #5 has to wait #1 and #2 to complete before starting
    * Service #6 has to wait #3 and #4 to complete before starting
* One service has two level of dependencies
    * Service #7 has to wait service #5 and #6 to complete before starting
## Todo
* Implement the logic described above 3 times:
    * 1st, try with callbacks
    * 2nd, try with Promises
    * 3rd, try with async/await
    * Each solution is technically the same, but the way you write your code can be quite weird at 1st sight
